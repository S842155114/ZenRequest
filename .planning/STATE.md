# GSD State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-04-06)

**Core value:** 让开发者以本地优先、快速、可控的方式完成高频 API 调试与工作流操作，而不被臃肿云平台和账号绑定打断。
**Current focus:** Define the next milestone

## Current Artifacts

- Project: `.planning/PROJECT.md`
- Config: `.planning/config.json`
- Requirements: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- Roadmap: `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- Codebase map: `.planning/codebase/`
- Milestone audit: `.planning/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`
- Latest milestone audit: `.planning/v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`

## Workflow State

- Project initialized as brownfield workspace
- Research, requirements, roadmap, and codebase mapping completed
- v1.0 has been archived and tagged
- v1.0.1 tag has been pushed to rerun release workflow on the post-archive CI/build fix commit
- v1.1 has been shipped, audited, and archived
- `v1.2 Usage Guidance & Product Manual` has been completed and archived
- Phase 12, 13, and 14 have all been planned, executed, and summarized
- Current status: no active milestone
- Recommended next step: run `$gsd-new-milestone`

## Branch Strategy

- `main` is the only long-lived branch
- Feature, fix, and GSD phase work should branch from `main`
- Before starting any new phase execution, create and switch to a dedicated phase branch first; do not execute phase work directly on `main`
- Pull requests should target `main`
- Completed branches should be deleted locally and remotely after merge

Recommended branch names:

- `feat/short-name`
- `fix/short-name`
- `gsd/phase-XX-short-name`
